## Hi there 👋
    
# 🚀 Welcome to **HardFOC** – Hardware-Accelerated Field Oriented Control

**HardFOC** is a high-performance, hardware-centric Field Oriented Control (FOC) framework designed for embedded systems. Unlike software-only solutions, HardFOC leverages hardware based FOC drivers to achieve ultra-efficient, real-time motor control with minimal CPU overhead.

> 💡 **HardFOC** stands for **Hardware-based FOC**, not because it's hard — but because it's fast, portable, and built for real-world embedded applications.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ **Hardware-accelerated FOC** using external FOC driver peripherals
- ✅ **Portable HAL architecture** for rapid adaptation to new MCUs
- ✅ **Modular design** supporting BLDC, PMSM, stepper, and DC motors
- ✅ **Sensor-agnostic**: supports encoders, Hall sensors, sensorless control
- ✅ **Driver-flexible**: works with gate drivers, integrated drivers, and smart FETs
- ✅ **Open-source and community-driven**
